# Navigating Large Codebases

# Purpose of this session

We will cover mindset and techniques for navigating arbitrily large codebases.

I will give some demonstrations.

You will practice this on the Unreal Engine 4 codebase.

---

# What is particular about a large codebase?

No one person can keep all the details of a large codebase in their head at the same time.

Different people know different parts of the codebase well. Some parts are not well known to anyone; whoever touched it last has left the company.

If you want to work effectively with a large codebase, you must learn to **work effectively with code that you do not understand well**.

# Tools and strategies

---

# Locate existing material

  * Source code
  * Compiled programs
  * Developer diaries / conference presentations
  * Developer documentation
  * API documentation
  * End-user documentation

---
  
# Use your experience & knowledge

  * Language(s)
  * OS & 3rd party libraries
  * Problem domain(s)
  * "How would a sensible programmer write this?"
  * Folder -> File -> Class -> Logic structure

---
  
# Use applicable tools

  * Text search
  * Decompiler/disassembler
  * Compiler/assembler
  * File format viewers
  * Hex editors

---

# How to find anything in a codebase

State your goal.

Find a starting spot in the codebase.

Walk from there, until you find what you are looking for.

---

# Finding a starting spot

Can you find it straight away?

If not... can you find something related?

If not... can you find _an aspect_ of it?

Cast a wide net, then narrow it down.

---

# Walking through the codebase

Read a small bit of code.

Understand what it does.

Remember _only_ what's relevant.

Move to a related bit of code.

Repeat.

---

# Example

Plastic SCM client.

How do I mute the hints?

---

# Example

UE4 codebase.

Where does the Editor application begin?

---

# Example

UE4 codebase.

Where is the runtime's main loop?

---

# Practice time

Work in pairs.

Pick something that you are curious about in the UE4 codebase.
Find it, and read up on it.

Examples:

How does TMap place items in memory? What is its growth strategy?

Does Unreal support multiple different gravity vectors at the same time?
