# Navigating Large Codebases

# Purpose of this session

We will cover mindset and techniques for navigating arbitrarily large codebases.

I will give some demonstrations.

You will practice this on the Unreal Engine 4 codebase.

---

# What is particular about a large codebase?

No one person can keep all the details of a large codebase in their head at the same time.

Different people know different parts of the codebase well. Some parts are not well known to anyone; whoever touched it last has left the company.

If you want to work effectively with a large codebase, you must learn to **work effectively with code that you do not understand well**.

---

# What is particular about a large codebase?

It is more than just one set of source files, in one language, that compiles to one executable.

It is likely a whole suite of applications and services, with different build & deployment processes.

If you want to work effectively with a large codebase, you must learn to **work effectively outside of a Visual Studio solution**.

# Tools & Materials

---

# Locate existing material

  * Source code
  * Compiled programs
  * Developer diaries / conference presentations
  * Developer documentation
  * API documentation
  * End-user documentation
  * Discussion forums

---
  
# Use your experience & knowledge

  * Language(s)
  * OS & 3rd party libraries
  * Problem domain(s)
  * "How would a sensible programmer write this?"
  * Folder -> File -> Class -> Logic structure

---
  
# Use applicable tools

  * Text search
  * Decompiler/disassembler
  * Compiler/assembler
  * File format viewers
  * Hex editors

# Strategies

---

# How to find anything in a codebase

State your goal.

Find a starting spot in the codebase.

Walk from there, until you find what you are looking for.

If this is not successful, find another starting spot, and try again.

---

# Finding a starting spot

Do you know of something tangible that would be a good start?'

Names of subsystems / methods / variables that are relevant?

If not... can you find something related?

If not... can you find _an aspect_ of it?

Cast a wide net, then narrow it down.

---

# Walking through the codebase

Read a small bit of code.

Understand what it does.

Remember _only_ what's relevant. Extend your mental model of the codebase.

Move to a related bit of code.

Repeat.

---

# Example

Plastic SCM client.

How do I mute the hints?

---

# Example

UE4 codebase.

Where does the Editor application begin?

---

# Example

UE4 codebase.

Where is the runtime's main loop?

---

# Practice time

Work in pairs.

Pick something that you are curious about in the UE4 codebase. Find it, and read up on it.

Examples:

How does TArray place items in memory? What is its growth strategy?

What is the difference between TSharedPtr, TSharedRef, and TScopedPointer?

Can Unreal support gravity in an arbitrary direction? What about per-object gravity?
